# Go Custom HTTP Server


First time playing with Golang.

This is an small app made to learn golang and how to handle HTTP request in a very basic way.

TODO list (For some day... Maybe)

* Move almost all the code on main to another file in the same package.
* Support other HTTP methods
* Respond in XML and JSON.
* Do some proper error handling because the current one is probably wrong.
* Make the templates more powerful. Maybe add some dynamic code in the template.

I hope to do that someday. Peace :+1:
